Iâ€™m Favio, a Software Developer with over four years of hands-on experience in JavaScript full-stack development. My expertise lies in crafting responsive, scalable, and high-performance web applications. From startups to SaaS platforms and eCommerce solutions, I have delivered successful projects involving internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n).

I have a solid foundation in both frontend and backend development, working extensively with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and SQL (PostgreSQL) databases. My approach incorporates best practices such as object-oriented programming (OOP), design patterns, and performance optimization. On the frontend, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and React. I also leverage advanced state management tools like Zustand, RxJS, and Redux to create maintainable and efficient applications.

My experience extends to API development, where Iâ€™ve worked with both REST and GraphQL. Additionally, I work with AWS services like S3, EC2, and ECS. I have integrated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to ensure smooth deployments and continuous integration, using tools like webpack, husky, prettier, and eslint to improve development productivity.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated with dynamic, cross-functional, remote teams worldwide and contributed to startups and SaaS companies. Whether itâ€™s optimizing performance, implementing cutting-edge features, or ensuring smooth deployments, I always prioritize creating meaningful and measurable outcomes.

If youâ€™re looking for a full-stack developer with a keen eye for detail, a passion for React and modern web technologies, and a proven track record of impactful contributions, Iâ€™d love to connect and explore how my expertise can bring value to your next project.
