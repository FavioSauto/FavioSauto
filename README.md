# Welcome!

I'm Favio 🙋🏻‍♂️, a Senior Front-end Engineer with over four years of experience dedicated to building exceptional web applications.

My primary tools are ReactJS, NextJS, and TypeScript.

I have a track record of enhancing customer retention and user engagement. One of my notable achievements was at Unosquare, where I developed a feature that dramatically reduced the completion time of a recurring task from an hour to just five minutes ⏱️.

Though I've been actively coding and delivering impactful functionalities throughout my career 💪🏻, my current GitHub repository doesn't showcase the full scope of my expertise 🥲. Much of my significant work is embedded within private company codebases and isn't publicly accessible. However, my skills and breadth of experience are evident from my professional accomplishments and work history 🏆.

I possess proficiency in various full-stack technical tools 🛠️ and languages, including SQL, Node.js, and Python. My collaborative skills shine through in roles where I mentored five new developers at Encora and led an internal community of over 25 members at Unosquare.

I've integrated generative AI 🤖 into my development approach, always prioritizing security and privacy 🔐. Leveraging advanced tools like zero-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting, I've been able to produce high-quality code more efficiently. As a committed lifelong learner 🎓, I continuously update my knowledge with the latest industry trends to hone my skills.

If you're in search of a senior front-end engineer adept in ReactJS, NextJS, and TypeScript, I offer a track record of significant contributions. I'm keen to explore how my expertise can drive growth for your projects 📈. Let's connect 🤝 and discuss potential synergies for your upcoming initiatives!
